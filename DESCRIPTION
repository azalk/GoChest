Description: This package efficiently implements consistent algorithms proposed by A. Khaleghi, D. Ryabko
    (2014) <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/khaleghi14.html> and A.
    Khaleghi, D. Ryabko (2012)
    <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/299fb2142d7de959380f91c01c3a293c-Paper.pdf>, which estimate distributional 
    changepoints in piecewise stationary timeseries in the presence of long-range dependencies. The code is written in Go and interfaced with R.
