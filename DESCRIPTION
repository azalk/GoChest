Description: Provides algorithms to locate multiple
    distributional change-points in piecewise stationary time series. The
    algorithms are provably consistent, even in the presence of long-range
    dependencies. Knowledge of the number of change-points is not
    required. The code is written in Go and interfaced with R.
