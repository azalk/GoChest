Description: This package efficiently implements algorithms which locate multiple distributional changepoints in piecewise stationary timeseries. The algorithms are provably consistent, even in the presence of long-range dependencies. Knowledge of the number of changepoints is not required a-priori. The code is written in Go and interfaced with R.
