Description: We are using an implementation in Go with a strong
    focus on parallel computation in order to locate distributional
    changes in piece-wise stationary time-series with long-range
    dependencies like suggested by the papers A. Khaleghi, D. Ryabko
    (2014) <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/khaleghi14.html> and A.
    Khaleghi, D. Ryabko (2012)
